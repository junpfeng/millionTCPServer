## Introduce

The purpose of the project is to build a `TCP` server that supports millions of connections. The project's feature is that it does not use any third-party network library, but uses the system's own `select` „ÄÅ`epoll`or`IOCP` models to build the server and provide relatively complete Supporting functions. The project will be continuously updated.

## Usage

### Linux

* **configure file**

  *updating*

* **start the server side**

  Enter the` HelloSocket / EasyTcpServer `directory, execute the `make` command to compile and generate the executable file on the server side, execute the `./server` command to run the server.

* **start the client side**

  Enter the`HelloSocket / EasyTcpClient`directory, execute the `make` command to compile and generate the executable file on the server side, execute the `./client` command to run the client.

### Windows

* **configure file**

  updating

* **others**

  In the `Windows` environment, it is recommended to use the relevant `IDE` and just add the source file, so I won't go into details
